## Opening an Issue

We always welcome issues, if you've seen something that isn't quite right or you have a suggestion for a new feature, please go ahead and open an issue in this project. Include as much information as you have, it really helps.

## Making a Code Change

Unfortuantely as this repository is mostly a pointer to a hosted service, we cannot take pull requests. If you are having any issues, please open an issue and we can see what we can do from there.
